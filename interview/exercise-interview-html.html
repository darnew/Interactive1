  <p>Mary Vainstein is a student at California College of the Arts in San Francisco, CA and Oakland, CA. As a child she was an avid people watcher. Over the years she transitioned from people watching to actively taking control of situations big and small. She describes herself as outgoing, kind, and adventurous.</p>

  <h2>Conversation</h2>
    <h4>What do you think is the purpose of the web?</h4>
      <p>Originally I believed the purpose of the web was communication—though communication is still one of the main purposes of the web—e-commerce is now just as prevalent.</p>

  <h4>How does the web impact graphic design?</h4>
    <p>Web impacts graphic design because design is what you see. I look at graphic design as the face of the web.</p>

  <h4>How did you become interested in graphic design?</h4>
    <p>I became interested in graphic design when I was seventeen and discovered the NASA Graphic Standards Manual. At the time I wasn’t even sure what I was looking at but I quickly became enamored and wanted to create things like it.</p>
